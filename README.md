# AppOint
AppOint is an Android app that allows you to create appointments with your friends, but designed with an interface that doesn't allow you to have any conversation. Useful for that people that doesn't want to loose so much time talking by the phone but still wants to meet his friends.

It connects to the service provided by the JSON interface server https://github.com/david-campos/mobilesoftware_server.
